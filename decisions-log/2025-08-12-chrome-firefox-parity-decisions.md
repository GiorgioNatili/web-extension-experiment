**Implementation:**
```typescript
async function processFileWithStreaming(file: File): Promise<void> {
  const operationId = generateOperationId();
  
  // Initialize streaming
  const initResponse = await chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
    type: 'STREAM_INIT',
    operation_id: operationId,
    file: { name: file.name, size: file.size, type: file.type }
  });
  
  // Process chunks with progress UI
  // Finalize analysis
}
```

- Mock-based testing approach for browser APIs
- Comprehensive coverage of all new features

**Test Structure:**
```
Chrome Tests:
- popup.test.ts: 25 tests (UI, status, toggle, error handling)
- options.test.ts: 20 tests (settings, validation, persistence)
- service-worker.test.ts: 15 tests (streaming, WASM)
- content.test.ts: 20 tests (file processing, UI)
```

**Impact:**
- High confidence in code quality
- Regression prevention
- Easier maintenance and refactoring

### 7. Mock-Based Testing Approach

**Decision:** Use mock-based testing for browser extension APIs

**Rationale:**
- Browser APIs are not available in Jest environment
- Need for reliable and fast test execution
- Consistent testing approach across extensions
- Focus on business logic rather than browser integration

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Mock chrome API
const mockChrome = {
  runtime: { sendMessage: jest.fn() },
  storage: { local: { get: jest.fn(), set: jest.fn() } }
};

// Mock DOM elements
const mockDocument = {
  getElementById: jest.fn(),
  addEventListener: jest.fn()
};
```

**Impact:**
- Fast and reliable test execution
- Focus on business logic testing
- Consistent testing approach

### 8. Code Organization and Modularity

**Decision:** Maintain modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

**Rationale:**
- Need for maintainable and testable code
