# Decisions Log

This folder contains a chronological record of all technical decisions made during the development of the SquareX browser extension project.

## Purpose

The decisions log serves as a historical record and reference document for:

- **Technical Decision Tracking**: Record why specific technologies, architectures, and approaches were chosen
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Maintain context for future developers and maintainers
- **Decision Rationale**: Document the reasoning behind architectural choices
- **Lessons Learned**: Capture insights from implementation challenges and solutions
- **Future Reference**: Provide context for future architectural decisions

## Structure

Each decisions log file follows the naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
```

For example:
- `2025-08-10-project-setup-decisions.md` - Initial project setup and architecture decisions

## Content Format

Each decisions log entry includes:

1. **Date and Context**: When the decision was made and what phase of the project
2. **Decision**: What was decided
3. **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
4. **Implementation**: How the decision was implemented
5. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
6. **Impact**: Consequences and trade-offs of the decision
7. **Future Considerations**: How this decision affects future development

## Current Entries

### [2025-08-10-project-setup-decisions.md](2025-08-10-project-setup-decisions.md)
**Scope**: Initial project setup and implementation  
**Key Decisions**:
- Monorepo architecture with npm workspaces
- Rust/WASM for analysis engine
- TypeScript for extensions and shared code
- Webpack for extension bundling
- Manifest V3 for Chrome extension
- Cross-browser abstraction layer
- Comprehensive testing strategy

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create a New Entry
- Major architectural decisions
- Technology stack changes
- Significant implementation approaches
- Performance or security decisions
- Build system modifications
- Dependency changes

### How to Write an Entry
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what was decided
2. **Provide Context**: Explain the problem or requirement
3. **Document Rationale**: Why this approach was chosen
4. **Include Implementation**: How the decision was put into practice
5. **Consider Alternatives**: What other options were evaluated
6. **Assess Impact**: What are the consequences and trade-offs
7. **Look Forward**: How does this affect future decisions

### Maintenance
- Review and update existing entries as the project evolves
- Add new entries for significant decisions
- Keep entries concise but comprehensive
- Link related decisions when appropriate

## Benefits

### For Current Team
- **Shared Understanding**: Everyone knows why decisions were made
- **Consistency**: Maintain architectural consistency across the project
- **Onboarding**: New team members can understand project context quickly

### For Future Development
- **Historical Context**: Understand the evolution of the project
- **Decision Patterns**: Identify successful approaches for future use
- **Avoiding Pitfalls**: Learn from past challenges and solutions

### For Project Maintenance
- **Troubleshooting**: Understand why certain approaches were chosen
- **Refactoring**: Make informed decisions about architectural changes
- **Documentation**: Provide context for technical documentation

## Integration with Other Documentation

The decisions log complements other project documentation:

- **README.md**: Provides high-level project overview
- **docs/plan.md**: Outlines project planning and architecture
- **docs/analysis.md**: Technical analysis and requirements
- **docs/implementation-status.md**: Current implementation status
- **Component READMEs**: Specific implementation details

## Example Decision Entry

```markdown
## 3.1.1 Analysis Engine Architecture
**Decision**: Implement modular analysis algorithms  
**Rationale**:
- Separation of concerns for different analysis types
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Extensible design for future algorithms
- Clear API boundaries

**Implementation**:
```rust
src/
├── analysis/
│   ├── frequency.rs    # Word frequency analysis
│   ├── phrases.rs      # Banned phrase detection
│   ├── pii.rs          # PII pattern detection
│   └── entropy.rs      # Entropy calculation
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single monolithic analysis function
- Plugin-based architecture (overkill for current needs)

**Impact**:
- ✅ Easier to test individual algorithms
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Extensible for future analysis types
- ⚠️ Slightly more complex initial setup
```

**Note**: This decisions log is a living document that should be maintained and updated as the project evolves. Regular reviews ensure it remains a valuable resource for the development team.
